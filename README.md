# DATA-SCIENCE

The Data Science plan starts with a comprehensive introduction to data science, offering a detailed overview of its core concepts, applications, and growing importance across industries like healthcare, finance, marketing, and technology. Participants will dive into key topics such as data collection methods, where they’ll learn how to gather reliable datasets, and data preprocessing techniques, focusing on cleaning, organizing, and preparing data for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will teach them how to discover patterns, trends, and insights within the data.


The curriculum also covers advanced topics, including statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression, classification, clustering), and deep learning models. The focus will be on Python as the primary programming language for implementing these techniques. Along with theoretical knowledge, the plan emphasizes hands-on learning through practical exercises, projects, and real-world case studies to help participants develop the skills necessary to become successful data scientists. By the end, they’ll be equipped with the tools to handle complex data science challenges in various domains.
